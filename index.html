<h1> About me </h1>

taika augustaitis - computer science student and researcher
I am a Student at the University of Michigan School of Information. I am an aspiring full stack developer with an intense interest in increasing my backend development skills. I'm currently teaching myself Linux and taking a class in database application design. 

The focus of most of my work within my community has been with the LGBTQ+ community. I identify as trans and am passionate about increasing access to more access to resources for LGBTQ+ youth and the intersections thereof with other identities. 

I am so happy to be a student here and excited to collaborate on more projects in the future!  


My hobbies include ...
learning about other people's cultures and traveling to historical sites when I can.Â 
doing karate. 
running. 
photography.
coding <.../>
