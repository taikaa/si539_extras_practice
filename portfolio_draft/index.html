Title Transmasculine style blog

Hi my name's Taika and I wanted to create a clothing and lifestyle blog to hopefully help other trans guys and/or other FAB people within the TNB umbrella to find things that fit! I actually used to wear all black clothing all the time, head to toe. I'm starting to reintroduce color into my wardrobe and finding more interest in pairing my black clothes with 1 item of color at least.

Why I wanted to make a blog ...

There are some awesome resources out there for trans guys about clothing brands that are made for guys with hips. The challenge I have found is trying to find gender-affirming clothes for myself on a budget. Specially tailored clothes can be $$$$$; I've never tailored my clothes yet #goals. I have shopped women's, men's, and youth departments and I am trying to get the chemistry down of which items fit and which don't.

I'll going to try my best to share the knowledge I have learned from trial and error of shopping at random or wearing my brother's hand me downs. That being said things fit everyone very differently and people have their own preferences for fit so I defintely know that this is not generalizable to everyone.
