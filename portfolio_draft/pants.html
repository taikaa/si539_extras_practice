I typically like my bottoms to have a tighter fit and used to wear skinny jeans pretty regularly. I wear a mixture of men's and women's pants depending on factors of cost and size. For me it entirely depends on the brand.
For reference my inseam is 30" and I'm 5'7". I have narrow hips but still have an hourglass effect at my waist. What I look for depends entirely on the type of bottoms.

Jeans
I wear mostly men's jeans but have some women's jeans. For men's jeans, I always look for a super skinny fit. There is no formula for me to predict which brands of men's jeans will fit. It's completely trial and error but do not get discouraged! Once you find your brand, it is much easier.

The goods: Levi 510, American Eagle super skinny,  



When shopping I look for
* garments that are tight in the legs
* for pants I make sure I can belt them
