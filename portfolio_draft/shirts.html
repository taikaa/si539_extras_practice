Every guy trans or not has their own preference for how shirts should fit.
What I look for:
* a boxy shape rather than an hourglass shape
* not too tight in the upper arms
* a petite fit
* able to cuff sleeves, if necessary
* sleeves that tighten are tapered at the hands so if they're too long it's not a big deal

I have tried different men's and women's shirt brands and have found some brands that work well for different occasions.

T-shirts:
I wear t-shirts all the time when I don't have to dress up. I typically layer them under sweaters too so I don't ruin them. My go to is a basic crewneck or v-neck.
Some fit looser, others more tight. I'm not very picky about how they fit. If the sleeves are too long, I just cuff them.

The good:
I love the Uniqlo and American Apparel basics. I only have 1 American Apparel t-shirt because they are pricey but the size small fits me really well in length.

The bad:
Many athletic brands run very large so I cannot wear Nike or Adidas size small shirts for example.

Sweaters:
Sweaters are easy to dress up or wear casually. Usually I get swallowed up by men's smalls or even xs at H&M are far too large on me. I typically look for boxy shaped women's sweaters. However, I've had really good luck at H&M with their women's sweaters and they look pretty unisex. Recently, I discovered Uniqlo sweaters which do extended sizes. A size XS fits me great. The only thing I have to do is cuff the sleeves one time.

The Good:
Uniqlo men's sweaters and H&M women's Sweaters

The bad:
Most department store brands of men's sweaters run very large, even in size xs





I am about 5'7" so all men's shirts have been too long on me in the sleeves. Women's shirts fit great in the sleeves but I don't like how the body is tapered.
